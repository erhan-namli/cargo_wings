    Gathering relevant data for training and testing your machine learning models. This could involve indoor maps, drone sensor data, communication logs, and historical task allocation data.
    Preprocess the data to make it suitable for training. This may include data cleaning, feature engineering, and data augmentation.

- Model Selection and Development:

    Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms and models for each of the defined tasks. For example:
    Path Planning: You might use reinforcement learning or deep Q-networks.
    Task Allocation: This could involve optimization algorithms, reinforcement learning, or deep learning approaches.
    Communication Optimization: Investigate techniques for adaptive communication and data transmission strategies.
